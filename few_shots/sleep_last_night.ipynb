It's important to ensure that you are not only getting enough sleep but also achieving good quality sleep by spending sufficient time in deep and REM sleep stages. If you notice any patterns of insufficient or poor-quality sleep, try setting a regular sleep schedule, aiming for 7-9 hours of sleep each night, and creating a relaxing bedtime routine to help improve your sleep quality.\")"
