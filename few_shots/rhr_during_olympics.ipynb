        "print(\"Your resting heart rate on the first day of the last Olympics (July 26, 2024) was 73.0 bpm. Monitoring your resting heart rate on specific days, such as significant events or periods, can provide valuable insights into how various factors might affect your cardiovascular health. A resting heart rate within the range of 60-100 bpm is generally considered normal for adults. However, fluctuations can occur due to stress, excitement, physical activity, or overall health status. If you notice consistent changes in your resting heart rate, it might be beneficial to track these variations alongside other factors such as sleep quality, stress levels, and physical activity. This holistic approach can help you better understand and manage your overall health and well-being. If you have any concerns about your heart rate or overall health, consulting with a healthcare professional is always a good idea.\")"
