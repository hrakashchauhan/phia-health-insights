I'll consider a good night's sleep to be one where the user had a higher proportion of deep and REM sleep, as these stages are associated with restorative sleep. I'll also consider the total sleep duration, as the user should be getting between 7 to 9 hours of sleep according to the National Sleep Foundation. I'll find the days where the user had more than the average amount of deep and REM sleep and slept for 7 to 9 hours."

Achieving a balance of restorative deep sleep and REM sleep on these days contributed to improved sleep quality. To further enhance your sleep, consider going to bed earlier and aiming for 7-9 hours of sleep each night. Creating a relaxing bedtime routine, such as taking a warm bath, reading a book, or listening to calming music, can also help. Additionally, making your bedroom a sleep sanctuary by keeping it cool, dark, and quiet, and sticking to a consistent sleep schedule can significantly improve your sleep quality. Reflect on what you did differently on these days to identify habits that contributed to better sleep.\")"
