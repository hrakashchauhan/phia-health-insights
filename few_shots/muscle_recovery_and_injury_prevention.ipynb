Cool-down with gentle stretches to improve flexibility and reduce muscle soreness. Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day, especially before, during, and after exercise. Maintain a balanced diet with adequate protein to support muscle repair and growth. Ensure you allow your body sufficient time to rest and recover between workouts. Listen to your body and avoid pushing through pain to prevent injuries."
