This suggests that on days when you get a bit more sleep, you still manage to engage in aerobic exercise, which is great for maintaining overall health and energy levels. To keep your energy levels up and stay fit, consider adding a short burst of exercise on days you sleep in. Even 10-15 minutes of something enjoyable, like a brisk walk or a quick bike ride, can make a significant difference. Remember, everyone is different. Listen to your body and find what works best for you.\")"
