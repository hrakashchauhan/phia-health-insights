This information can be used to calculate the Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and then adjust for activity level to estimate total daily energy expenditure (TDEE). Since the user metadata provides age, gender, height, and weight, I can use this information to calculate BMR using a formula like the Harris-Benedict equation. However, the average daily steps provided may not be sufficient to accurately determine the activity level, so I will assume a light activity level for the calculation."
