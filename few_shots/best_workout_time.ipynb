        "print(\"The best time to work out considering diet and mealtimes depends on your individual preferences and schedule. However, you should consider having a small snack—around 200-250 calories—that is low in fat, low in fiber, and emphasizes protein and carbohydrates, such as a banana, about an hour before you begin your workout. Afterward, have a proper meal to replenish your energy stores. Here are some general guidelines: Before breakfast is good for burning fat but you may lack energy. Before lunch is ideal if you eat a large breakfast, providing energy from your meal. After lunch can aid digestion, but avoid intense workouts too soon after eating. Before dinner provides energy for your workout and may boost metabolism. After dinner is not ideal for digestion or sleep but can work if you have a light dinner. Ultimately, listen to your body and experiment to find what works best for you.\")"
