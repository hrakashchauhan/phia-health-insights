        "print(\"Outdoor biking is associated with the largest decrease in your stress management score. When you bike outside, your score decreases by 5.8 points on average. This suggests that engaging in outdoor biking is particularly effective at helping you manage and reduce stress. To further benefit from this activity, try to incorporate regular outdoor biking sessions into your routine. Not only will it help lower your stress levels, but it can also contribute to your overall physical and mental well-being. Keep exploring different activities to find what works best for you in managing stress.\")"
