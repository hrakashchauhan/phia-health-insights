Begin with a basic meditation exercise: Start by taking a few deep breaths and focusing on your breath. Notice the sensations in your body as you breathe in and out. Allow your mind to wander, but gently bring it back to your breath whenever you notice it has drifted. Continue for a few minutes, or for as long as you like. Additionally, consider engaging your senses, being present, practicing mindful movement, and taking regular technology breaks."
