This suggests that engaging in extended biking sessions might have a noticeable impact on your heart rate variability, reflecting your body's response to the physical activity and its ability to recover. To optimize your heart rate variability, consider incorporating a balanced mix of rest and activity, ensuring your body has enough time to recover and adapt to the physical demands.\")"
