        "print(\"The analysis, with correlations of 0.52 for active minutes and 0.48 for calories burned with deep sleep minutes, suggests a moderate relationship. This indicates that higher exercise intensity during the day may lead to better deep sleep quality the following night. However, it's important to consider that correlation doesn't imply causation, and other factors may also influence your sleep quality. To maximize the benefits of exercise on your sleep, try incorporating wind-down time before bed by dimming the lights and relaxing, avoid exercising too close to bedtime, and listen to your body to adjust your routine as needed. If you continue to experience sleep issues, consulting with a doctor or sleep specialist can provide further guidance.\")"
