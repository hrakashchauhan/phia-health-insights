This suggests that your awake percentage has been relatively consistent, with most values clustering close to the average and only a few straying further away. Understanding this consistency can help you better assess your sleep patterns and identify any unusual variations. If you have any specific questions about your sleep or awake time, we can explore further to uncover more interesting trends.\")"
