        "\n",
        "**Sleep Patterns**\n",
        "- **Irregular Sleep Onset and Wake Times:** Your sleep onset and wake times have been inconsistent over the past week. This irregularity is often a sign of jet lag, as your body is struggling to adjust to a new time zone.\n",
        "- **Reduced Total Sleep Time:** There is a noticeable decrease in your total sleep duration, particularly on the days following your travel. Jet lag can disrupt your sleep cycle, leading to shorter sleep duration.\n",
        "- **Increased Sleep Fragmentation:** Your data shows increased instances of waking up during the night. Fragmented sleep is a common symptom of jet lag, as your internal clock is out of sync with the local time.\n",
        "- **Significant Shift in Bedtime:** The largest shift in bedtime is 676.5 minutes, which is about 11.2 hours. This significant shift could be a sign of jet lag, but it could also be due to other factors like changes in work schedule or social events.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Analysis of Sleep Data**\n",
        "- Before the shift, the average sleep duration was approximately 491.83 minutes, and the average sleep score was around 76.23.\n",
        "- After the shift, the average sleep duration increased to about 759.5 minutes, while the average sleep score decreased to 64.69.\n",
        "- These changes suggest a possible disruption in your sleep patterns. The increase in sleep duration might indicate an attempt to recover from a sleep deficit, but the drop in sleep score suggests that the quality of sleep might have been affected. This pattern could be indicative of factors such as jet lag or other disruptions affecting your sleep quality.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Activity Patterns**\n",
        "- **Decreased Daytime Activity:** There’s a drop in your daytime activity levels, which might be due to fatigue and lethargy associated with jet lag. This can also contribute to a feeling of tiredness during the day.\n",
        "- **Inconsistent Peak Activity Times:** Your peak activity times have shifted, indicating that your body is not yet aligned with the local daily schedule. This misalignment is a typical sign of jet lag as your body’s internal clock is adjusting.\n",
        "\n",
        "By following these insights and adjusting your routine accordingly, you can work towards mitigating the effects of jet lag and improving your overall well-being.\n",
