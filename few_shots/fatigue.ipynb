You can find it in foods like nuts, seeds, whole grains, and dairy. If you have severely low levels of magnesium, it can raise your risk for diseases like diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart conditions. But you don't need a lot of magnesium per day. Just a few servings of magnesium-rich foods can help you meet your daily minimum. But high doses of magnesium in supplement form can cause side effects like diarrhea and nausea. Before you take magnesium supplements, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\"\n"
