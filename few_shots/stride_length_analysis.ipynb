        "print(\"\"\"\n",
        "Absolutely, stride length is an important factor in running efficiency. Let's take a look at your stride length data and provide some insights on whether you should adjust it:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Stride Length Analysis:**\n",
        "- **Average Stride Length:** Your average stride length is currently about 1.28 meters.\n",
        "- **Consistency:** Your stride length tends to be shorter during the latter half of your runs, particularly after the 5 km mark.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Optimal Stride Length:**\n",
        "- **Cadence and Stride Length Balance:** An optimal running form typically balances cadence (steps per minute) and stride length. Elite runners often have a cadence of around 170-180 steps per minute.\n",
        "- **Efficiency:** Overstriding (taking longer strides) can lead to inefficiency and increase the risk of injury, while understriding can limit speed.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Recommendations for Adjusting Stride Length:**\n",
        "- **Focus on Cadence:**\n",
        "  - **Observation:** Your current average steps per minute is 63, which is lower than optimal.\n",
        "  - **Recommendation:** Aim for a cadence of 170-180 steps per minute. You can practice this by using a metronome or a running app that tracks cadence.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Drills to Improve Stride Length:**\n",
        "  - **High Knees:** This drill helps improve knee lift and stride length. Perform high knees for 30 seconds, focusing on quick turnover and lifting your knees to hip height.\n",
        "  - **Butt Kicks:** This helps improve the efficiency of your leg cycle. Perform butt kicks for 30 seconds, ensuring your heels touch your glutes.\n",
        "  - **Stride Outs:** Gradually accelerate to 85-90% of your maximum speed for 100 meters, focusing on maintaining a quick cadence and proper form.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Strength and Flexibility:**\n",
        "  - **Hip Flexors and Glutes:** Strengthening these muscles can help improve your stride length naturally. Incorporate exercises like lunges, squats, and hip bridges into your routine.\n",
        "  - **Flexibility:** Ensure youâ€™re regularly stretching your hamstrings, hip flexors, and calves to maintain flexibility, which supports a longer stride.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Form Checks:**\n",
        "  - **Posture:** Keep an upright posture with a slight forward lean from the ankles, not the waist. This helps with an efficient stride.\n",
        "  - **Foot Strike:** Aim for a midfoot strike rather than heel striking, which can reduce overstriding and improve overall efficiency.\n",
