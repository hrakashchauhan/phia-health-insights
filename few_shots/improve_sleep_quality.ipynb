Additionally, the variability in your bedtimes and wake-up times suggests an irregular sleep schedule. To improve your sleep quality, consider the following tips: Keep a consistent sleep schedule by going to bed and waking up at the same time each day, even on weekends. Establish a relaxing bedtime routine, such as reading, taking a warm bath, or listening to calming music, and avoid screens. Create a sleep-friendly environment by ensuring your bedroom is dark, quiet, and cool. Exercise regularly, but avoid intense workouts close to bedtime. Watch your diet, and limit caffeine and alcohol before bed."
