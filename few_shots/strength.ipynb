Prioritize compound exercises like squats, lunges, and push-ups that work multiple muscle groups. Bodyweight training can also be very effective; utilize your own weight for resistance with exercises like planks and dips. Remember to listen to your body, rest adequately, and fuel your workouts with proper nutrition to support your strength goals without adding bulk.\")"
